        <h3>Journal Entry 1</h3>
        <p class="fw-bold">Day 1 of Investigation:</p><p class="fw-semi-bold">Cyberattack at Samsan Tech</p>
        <p class="fst-italic"> When a company called Samsan Tech launched their self-driving car, 
            that's where they face a problem called ransomware their CEO was shocked. Their CEO Seo Dal Mi 
            immediately call for help and find someone who might help. I was happened to be one of her closest friend
            so I was the first one she called that moment, it also happened to be that day that I was in Korea to meet a client. 
            I have learned that in order to allow the new developer to work from home, 
            the developers at Samsan Tech opened up port 22 on one of their office computers. 
            Port 22 gave the new developer access to the command line 
            of the office computer, also known as an SSH connection. </p>

    <h3>Journal Entry 2</h3>
    <p class="fw-bold">Day 2 of Investigation:</p><p class="fw-semi-bold">Cyberattack at Samsan Tech</p>
    <p class="fst-italic"> The moment where Dal Mi have mentioned about opening a port to allow their employees.
        I already have instinct about it, but knowing this job I will not only consider my instinct but the evidence itself
        also the history of people who accessed it. In order to know history, I checked it first on the terminal. 
        It took us 3 days to resolve the attack, looking it in terminal history seems like not enough, this is why I'm writing up my journal in day 2. 
        I try opening the port and when I opened this port, it was not only opened to the new developer, but it was opened to the entire internet. This is a process commonly known as “port forwarding”. </p>

    <h3>Journal Entry 3</h3>
    <p class="fw-bold">Day 3 of Investigation:</p><p class="fw-semi-bold">Cyberattack at Samsan Tech</p>
    <p class="fst-italic"> What makes this project even more harder is that there are a lot internet of hackers,
        and there is only 50% chance that we could find the culprit behind the attack. 
        But after checking out the recent logs and usernames of the people who had access in port.
        We've learned that the user who made the attack is one of the employee base on the IP address, 
        so we checked the main computer to see who is the owner of that IP address and we have found out,
        that it is from the laptop of one their senior developer. The reason why he did it is because 
        he wants his position to went up higher. This wasn't my first case but this has been the longer 
        time interval that I solved it that is why you are now in my 3rd day of writing up my journey as a cybersecurity agent, 
        but all in all it was a great experience, I get to explore and most importantly it was already a case closed.</p>
